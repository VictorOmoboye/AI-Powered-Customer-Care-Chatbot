## DESCRIPTION 
This project demonstrates a customer care chatbot that blends AI text generation and pre-scripted decision trees to enhance digital customer service experiences. The chatbot:

- Provides instant answers to frequently asked questions like ‚ÄúHow do I get a refund?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs my order?‚Äù
- Uses BlenderBot, a conversational NLP model, to manage general queries and simulate real customer-agent conversations.
- Maintains context-aware conversations, storing past responses and user inputs to create a chat history.
- Built with a lightweight Streamlit interface for quick deployment and UI interaction.

## METHODOLOGY
The chatbot operates through the following workflow:

1. **User Input:** The user types a question or concern into a text input box.

2. **Rule-Based Intent Recognition:**
   - If keywords such as ‚Äúrefund,‚Äù ‚Äúpayment,‚Äù or ‚Äúaccount‚Äù are detected, the chatbot serves a curated response.
   - If no direct match is found, it defers to BlenderBot for a general AI-generated reply.

3. **AI Response Generation:**
   - BlenderBot uses the input to predict a logical response based on pre-trained conversational data.

4. **Conversation Update:**
   - The conversation log is updated to preserve context and improve user experience.

5. **Front-End Display:**
    - The chatbot interface mimics real messaging platforms for a natural chat feel.
